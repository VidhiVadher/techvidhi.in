## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi folks!! I'm Vidhi, 
After spending over 4 years in the embedded systems domain — navigating datasheets, probing signals, decoding protocols, and wrestling with stubborn bugs — I’ve come to realize something:

> **The real growth doesn’t just come from solving problems... it comes from sharing what made us curious enough to solve them.**

Today, I’m starting a new chapter — not as a finished expert, but as a lifelong learner who’s ready to open up the black box and talk about the stuff that challenged me, confused me, and ultimately taught me something valuable.

This space will be where I share:

- 🔧 Technical deep-dives  
- 🧠 Hard-won insights  
- 🐛 Debugging adventures  
- 💡 Ideas that sparked unexpected “aha!” moments  

**My intent?**  
To not just share solutions — but to offer a different perspective, to spark curiosity, and to learn from the brilliant minds out there who see the same puzzle from another angle.

If you're someone who loves getting your hands dirty with embedded logic, who celebrates the little wins of making something *just work* — you’ll feel right at home here.

Let’s connect. Let’s question. Let’s build.  
Because in the end, we’re all students — just at different points in the journey.

📩 Open to feedback, suggestions, and meaningful conversations.  
🛠️ Let’s create and learn — together.
